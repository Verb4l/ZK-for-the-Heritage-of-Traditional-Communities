# ZK for the Heritage of Traditional Communities

## Project Abstract
This project aims to develop a blockchain-based solution using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK) technology to safeguard the authenticity, security, and privacy of property rights, cultural rights, and intangible heritage of traditional communities. By leveraging blockchain, the project seeks to empower these communities to maintain environmental resilience amidst climate and economic crises while preserving their cultural identity and heritage.

## Objectives
Our objective is to develop and implement a ZK-based solution on the Ethereum platform to safeguard the property rights of traditional communities. Success will be measured by the increased trust of these communities in their property rights, the resilience of their data during rural conflicts, and the advancement of sustainable management practices for natural and cultural resources.

## Outcomes
The study of ZK implementation in traditional communities addresses global challenges, contributes significantly to Ethereum enhancing scalability and privacy solutions while promoting standardized tooling and interfaces for ZK development. This innovative approach not only showcases the versatility of ZK technology but also underscores Ethereum's commitment to promoting inclusivity, privacy, and security across diverse socio-cultural contexts. Including a layer of technical and legal analysis to ensure compliance with local legislation for the blockchain solution being implemented. This solution is very important considering that these communities are permanently threatened in their territories and their constitutional rights, while their way of life guarantees the preservation of forests, rivers, fauna, and flora.

## Grant Scope
Our research will focus on investigating the effectiveness of ZK protocols in protecting the property rights of traditional communities, with a particular emphasis on benchmarking ZK performance, enhancing privacy solutions, and promoting standardized tooling and interfaces for ZK development.

- **Privacy-preserving KYC/AML/social attestations:**
  - Data anonymization methods: Implement cryptographic hashing techniques to ensure individuals' personal information remains private during the verification process.
  - Verification success rate: Measure the proportion of successful verifications performed relative to the total number of requests. This can be tracked through transaction records on the blockchain, where each successful verification is securely and immutably recorded.
  - Audit and compliance: Conduct regular audits to ensure that the verification process complies with KYC/AML regulations and privacy policies. This may involve reviewing transaction records and using specific monitoring tools.
  - User feedback: Collect user feedback on the experience of undergoing the verification process. This may include satisfaction surveys, analysis of complaints, and suggestions for improvements.
  - Collaboration with regulatory bodies: Establish partnerships with regulatory authorities to validate and enhance verification procedures. This may include securely and transparently sharing relevant data as required by local regulations.
  
- **Digital Wallet Adoption:**
  - Onboard at least 50% of the targeted 150 families in the traditional communities, in Serro, Minas Gerais, Brasil. Resulting in approximately 100 digital wallets created with local livings.
  - To create at least new 300 digital wallets in the local communities, community visitors, in the supply market that buys products from communities.
  - We target a minimum of 500 transactions within the first six months of implementation, showcasing the practical application and effectiveness of our blockchain-based system in facilitating secure property transfers and economic transactions. Users: community visitors, in the supply market who buy products from communities, local residents.
  
- **Technical-Legal Solutions Report:**  a technical document outlining the solutions developed to address the technical and legal challenges of implementing blockchain in traditional communities, ensuring compatibility with Brazilian legislation. By addressing both technical and legal aspects, our report serves as a roadmap for future projects and contributes significantly to the body of knowledge in blockchain governance.
  
- **Photo/Audiovisual Report:** We will produce a photojournalistic report with 50 high-quality photographs documenting project activities. Additionally, we'll create an online gallery, tracking engagement metrics like views, shares, and comments. This visual product will showcase blockchain's impact in traditional communities.
